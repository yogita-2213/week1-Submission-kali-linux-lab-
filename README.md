# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network
A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

![image alt](https://github.com/yogita-2213/week1-Submission-kali-linux-lab-/blob/96ca2830ee2286e0b3548e7ce32a2653554c4615/Screenshot%202026-10-30%20081459.png)

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
...

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```
A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example snapshot name:

```text
Clean Kali - Network Setup
```

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future exercise changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

# 🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting problems is an important part of the project.

## Problem 1. Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity may fail depending on the Kali/NetworkManager configuration.

One workaround used during this lab was:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0
```

The network connection was then restarted/rebooted and connectivity was tested again.

> **Important:** Network interface and connection names may differ between systems. Students should first identify their actual connection name before running an `nmcli` command.

---

## Problem 2. VirtualBox VT-x / Virtualization Error

The VM initially failed to start because hardware virtualization was disabled in the system firmware/BIOS.

The issue was resolved by:
1. Restarting the computer.
2. Entering BIOS/UEFI settings.
3. Enabling Intel VT-x / hardware virtualization.
4. Saving the configuration.
5. Restarting the computer.
6. Starting the Kali VM again.

After enabling virtualization, the VM started successfully.

Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration andS settings in Kali Linux.

### 4. VM Snapshots

I learned that a clean snapshot should be created **before performing risky or experimental activities**.

This provides a known-good recovery point for future cybersecurity exercises.

### 5. Documentation
I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems, and solutions is an important part of a professional cybersecurity project.
